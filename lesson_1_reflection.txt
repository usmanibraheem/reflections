How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is a very useful tool as the computer helps in finding the difference faster
    finding it manually without the diff command was a bit tideous if you ask me.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can make you view and compare old code so that when it gets complicated
    or run into a bug, you can revisit old code to realise what went wrong!



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual Commits are much Better than automatic commits



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I really dont know Doc

    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log to check commit history and git diff to check the difference between them.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It has the power to turn back time and find the errors



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    This reflections?!!!
